The core principles of this paradigm allow breaking the limitations for deriving analytics from limited centralized data, in terms of privacy concerns and operational costs.”1\nDiscerning characteristics:\nMonographs, very detailed:\nReview papers\nApplications in healthcare",

    "text": "2.1 The engines of data science and the paradox of open\nThe Computer History Museum recounts that the history of the Information Age is driven by three ‘engines’, namely the silicon engine, the storage engine and the internet as the networking engine. Each of these engines have been instrumental in the development in of data science as we know today. Without the silicon engine, we would not be able to train foundational large language models with over 1023 FLOPs.[^1] Without the storage engine and the internet, we would not be able to store and collect petabyte-sized datasets such as Common Crawl as input for these models.\nBesides the technological developments in and of themselves, the internet also gave birth to the open movement.[^2] Numerous organisations and initiatives have been launched with a belief in openness and free knowledge. Their proponents placed their bets on the combined power of networked information services and new governance models for the production and sharing of content and data. Members of this broad movement believed it possible to leverage this combination of power and opportunity to build a more democratic society, unleashing the power of the internet to create universal access to knowledge and culture. Such openness meant not only freedom, but also presented a path to justice and equality.\nHowever, the open revolution not happen. At least not on the scale that we and many other proponents of free culture expected. Although the copyright wars are almost over, conflicts about access to and control over informational resources have been superseded by conflicts about privacy, economic value extraction, the emergence of artificial intelligence, and the destabilising effects of dominant platforms on (democratic) societies. Instead of access to information, the control of personal data has emerged in the age of platforms as the critical contention.\nToday, open is both a challenge to and an enabler of concentrations of power. Over the last decade, we have witnessed a wholesale transformation of the networked information ecosystem. The web moved away from the ideals and the open design of the early internet and turned into an environment that is dominated by a small number of platforms.",
