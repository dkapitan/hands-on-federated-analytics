  abstract = {We apply multiparty computation (MPC) techniques to show, given a database that is secret-shared among multiple mutually distrustful parties, how the parties may obliviously construct a decision tree based on the secret data. We consider data with continuous attributes (i.e., coming from a large domain), and develop a secure version of a learning algorithm similar to the C4.5 or CART algorithms. Previous MPC-based work only focused on decision tree learning with discrete attributes (De Hoogh et al. 2014). Our starting point is to apply an existing generic MPC protocol to a standard decision tree learning algorithm, which we then optimize in several ways. We exploit the fact that even if we allow the data to have continuous values, which a priori might require fixed or floating point representations, the output of the tree learning algorithm only depends on the relative ordering of the data. By obliviously sorting the data we reduce the number of comparisons needed per node to O(N log2 N ) from the naive O(N 2), where N is the number of training records in the dataset, thus making the algorithm feasible for larger datasets. This does however introduce a problem when duplicate values occur in the dataset, but we manage to overcome this problem with a relatively cheap subprotocol. We show a procedure to convert a sorting network into a permutation network of smaller complexity, resulting in a round complexity of O(log N ) per layer in the tree. We implement our algorithm in the MP-SPDZ framework and benchmark our implementation for both passive and active three-party computation using arithmetic modulo 264. We apply our implementation to a large scale medical dataset of ≈ 290 000 rows using random forests, and thus demonstrate practical feasibility of using MPC for privacy-preserving machine learning based on decision trees for large datasets.},

Multi-party computation (MPC) is a new technique to compute meaningful insights without having to transfer data. This paper investigates if MPC affects known antecedents for data sharing decisions: control, trust, and risks. Through 23 qualitative interviews in the automotive industry, we find that MPC (1) enables new ways of technology-based control, (2) reduces the need for inter-organizational trust, and (3) prevents losing competitive advantage due to data leakage. However, MPC also creates the need to trust technology and introduces new risks of data misuse. These impacts arise if firms perceive benefits from sharing data, have high organizational readiness, and perceive data as non-sensitive. Our findings show that known antecedents of data sharing should be specified differently with MPC in place. Furthermore, we suggest reframing MPC as a data collaboration technology beyond enhancing privacy.},

Emerging privacy-enhancing technologies like multi-party computation (MPC), which allows generating insights while consumers retain data control, are challenging the current understanding of why consumers share their data. In this research-in-progress paper, we develop and evaluate an instrument and experimental design to investigate the impact of MPC on consumers’ willingness to share data and its antecedents. Preliminary analysis from a pre-study (N=300) indicates a good fit for our model. Also, MPC enhances consumers’ control and trust while reducing privacy concerns and risk, ultimately increasing data sharing willingness. The findings suggest that privacy-enhancing technologies significantly affect both the willingness to share data itself and its typical antecedents. The next step will conduct a large-scale online experiment using the developed instruments to evaluate further the impact of MPC on consumers’ willingness to share data.},

  abstract = {Data sharing through data marketplaces, which rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP), can benefit businesses and society. However, many companies and consumers are increasingly reluctant to share data due to mounting concerns over data control and privacy. Emerging privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which enables joint computation to generate insights while keeping the input data private, could address data sharing barriers due to its differences with the traditional data sharing approach relying on a TTP. Thus, MPC could challenge the current understanding of why and how businesses and consumers share data. Nevertheless, whether businesses and consumers would be more willing to share data with MPC in place is unclear, as less attention is given to the socio-technical implications of MPC on data sharing decisions in data marketplaces and its antecedents. This research aimed to theorize the socio-technical implications of MPC on sharing through data marketplaces, by investigating how MPC potentially impacts data sharing antecedents by businesses and individuals. We do so through a mixed-method research design focusing on the automotive industry. Based on interviews with 15 MPC experts, which were structured using a Unified Business Model framework, we explored value propositions enabled by MPC use in data marketplaces. These value propositions allow MPC to potentially impact control, privacy, trust, and risks as antecedents of data sharing decisions in data marketplaces. Subsequently, we interviewed 23 automotive industry experts to investigate the potential impact of MPC use in data marketplaces on control, trust, and risks as antecedents of business data sharing. We then conducted an experiment via an online crowdsourcing platform with 1457 participants to investigate the potential impact of MPC use in data marketplaces on control, privacy, trust, and risks as antecedents of consumer data sharing. In this way, we contribute to the socio-technical understanding of MPC beyond technical perspectives. At the same time, we also demonstrate the relevance of MPC to practitioners by pointing out key aspects that should be considered while exploring the possibility of implementing MPC. Furthermore, this research provides a foundation for future studies on understanding the socio-technical implications of MPC on data sharing decisions.},

To do so, after a description of the underlying concepts and modelling assumptions, we present different methods according to the family of approaches they belong to: Granger causality, constraint-based approaches, noise-based approaches, score-based approaches, logic-based approaches, topology-based approaches, and difference-based approaches. We then evaluate several representative methods to illustrate the behaviour of different families of approaches. This illustration is conducted on both artificial and real datasets, with different characteristics. The main conclusions one can draw from this survey is that causal discovery in times series is an active research field in which new methods (in every family of approaches) are regularly proposed, and that no family or method stands out in all situations. Indeed, they all rely on assumptions that may or may not be appropriate for a particular dataset.},

This distributed model ensures the privacy of data at each local node. Owing to its relevance, there has been extensive research activities and outcomes in federated learning with expanded applicability to different areas by the research community. As such, there is a vast research archive made available by the community with research work and articles related to the various aspects of federated learning such as applications, challenges, privacy, functionalities, and design. With respect to the function and design of federated learning, client selection, aggregation, knowledge transfer, management of distributed data (Non-IID), Incentive of data and communication cost are of paramount importance. Any effective design of federated learning requires these aspects to be well considered. There are numerous survey articles found among the available literature that focus on its application and challenges, opportunities, data privacy and protection, as well as on federated learning on internet of things, federated learning on edge computing, etc. In this paper, a review of the available literature on the various elements of design and functionalities in federated learning has been carried out with an aim to lay emphasis on the important challenges and research opportunities. More specifically, this work has endeavored to understand and summarize the various functional methods available, along with their techniques and goals. Additionally, it has strived to get a bird’s eye view of how various functions and designs of federated learning have been used in applications, and how it has helped uncover challenges and promising research directions for the future.},

Our technique leverages the results of a machine learning process for short time prediction to achieve our goal. The basic idea is to use the machine learning to estimate the elements of the Jacobian matrix of the dynamical flow along an orbit. The type of machine learning that we employ is reservoir computing. We present numerical tests on link inference of a network of interacting dynamical nodes. It is seen that dynamical noise can greatly enhance the effectiveness of our technique, while observational noise degrades the effectiveness. We believe that the competition between these two opposing types of noise will be the key factor determining the success of causal inference in many of the most important application situations.}

This paper develops business model archetypes for the full array of data marketplace types, ranging from private to independent ownership and from a hierarchical to a market orientation. Through exploratory interviews and case analyses, we create a business model taxonomy. Patterns in our taxonomy reveal four business model archetypes. We find that privately-owned data marketplaces with hierarchical orientation apply the aggregating data marketplace archetype. Consortium-owned data marketplaces apply the archetypes of aggregating data marketplace with additional brokering service and consulting data marketplace. Independently owned data marketplaces with market orientation apply the facilitating data marketplace archetype. Our results provide a basis for configurational theory that explains the performance of data marketplace business models. Our results also provide a basis for specifying boundary conditions for theory on data marketplace business models, as, for instance, the importance of network effects differs strongly between the archetypes.},

Appropriate adjustment for confounding in such studies is challenging because exposure is determined by a complex interaction of patient, physician, and healthcare system factors. The challenges of confounding control are particularly acute in studies using healthcare utilization databases where information on many potential confounding factors is lacking and the meaning of variables is often unclear. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to confounder control in healthcare databases. In settings where considerable uncertainty surrounds the data or the causal mechanisms underlying the treatment assignment and outcome process, we suggest that researchers report a panel of results under various specifications of statistical models.

  abstract = {The convenient access to copious multifaceted data has encouraged machine learning researchers to reconsider correlation-based learning and embrace the opportunity of causality-based learning, i.e., causal machine learning (causal learning). Recent years have, therefore, witnessed great effort in developing causal learning algorithms aiming to help artificial intelligence (AI) achieve human-level intelligence. Due to the lack of ground-truth data, one of the biggest challenges in current causal learning research is algorithm evaluations. This largely impedes the cross-pollination of AI and causal inference and hinders the two fields to benefit from the advances of the other. To bridge from conventional causal inference (i.e., based on statistical methods) to causal learning with Big Data (i.e., the intersection of causal inference and machine learning), in this survey, we review commonly used datasets, evaluation methods, and measures for causal learning using an evaluation pipeline similar to conventional machine learning. We focus on the two fundamental causal inference tasks and causality-aware machine learning tasks. Limitations of current evaluation procedures are also discussed. We, then, examine popular causal inference tools/packages and conclude with primary challenges and opportunities for benchmarking causal learning algorithms in the era of Big Data. The survey seeks to bring to the forefront the urgency of developing publicly available benchmarks and consensus-building standards for causal learning evaluation with observational data. In doing so, we hope to broaden the discussions and facilitate collaboration to advance the innovation and application of causal learning.},

  abstract = {As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?},

  abstract = {Data platforms are the keystone of the data economy. When opened up, data platforms allow data owners, data consumers and third parties to interact. Yet, openness may also harm business and societal interests. Literature on platform openness does not cover data platforms, and data economy scholars rarely study platform openness. Therefore, this paper develops a research agenda on the openness of data platforms. We explore how data platforms differ from conventional digital platforms (e.g., software platforms). From those differentiating characteristics, we identify areas for future work: (1) The specific characteristics of data require reconceptualizing the object of platform openness; (2) New ways in which data platforms can be opened should be conceptualized; (3) As data platforms are tailored to specific industries, platform-to-platform openness should be a novel unit of analysis; (4) Because opening up data platforms create novel risks, new reasons to (not) open up data platforms should be studied.},

The framework utilizes two key causal inference methods: Instrumental Variable (IV) and Counterfactual Inference (CF). IV helps identify and address confounding biases, improving recommendation accuracy. CF addresses data loss issues in federated learning, enabling the inference of possible scenarios and outcomes. Experimental results on the MIND and Adressa datasets demonstrate excellent performance in evaluation metrics. The FedCIRec framework has advantages over centralized storage and user privacy protection methods. Further exploration of causal inference methods and optimization of recommendation effects while protecting user privacy are areas for future research. Introducing causal inference techniques in federated recommendation systems has broad research and practical application prospects.},

  abstract = {Federated Learning is an emerging privacy-preserving distributed machine learning approach to building a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices (clients) and aggregating the local models into a global one. As this approach prevents data collection and aggregation, it helps in reducing associated privacy risks to a great extent. However, the data samples across all participating clients are usually not independent and identically distributed (noni.i.d.), and Out of Distribution (OOD) generalization for the learned models can be poor. Besides this challenge, federated learning also remains vulnerable to various attacks on security wherein a few malicious participating entities work towards inserting backdoors, degrading the generated aggregated model as well as inferring the data owned by participating entities. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning invariant (causal) features common to all participating clients in a federated learning setup and analyse empirically how it enhances the Out of Distribution (OOD) accuracy as well as the privacy of the final learned model.},

In a typical FL scenario, clients exhibit significant heterogeneity in terms of data distribution and hardware configurations. Thus, randomly sampling clients in each training round may not fully exploit the local updates from heterogeneous clients, resulting in lower model accuracy, slower convergence rate, degraded fairness, etc. To tackle the FL client heterogeneity problem, various client selection algorithms have been developed, showing promising performance improvement. In this article, we systematically present recent advances in the emerging field of FL client selection and its challenges and research opportunities. We hope to facilitate practitioners in choosing the most suitable client selection mechanisms for their applications, as well as inspire researchers and newcomers to better understand this exciting research topic.},

  abstract = {Background: An essential step in any medical research project after identifying the research question is to determine if there are sufficient patients available for a study and where to find them. Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing. Objective: This study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data. Methods: We analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service. Results: We implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative. Conclusions: We designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.},

  abstract = {Access to health data, important for population health planning, basic and clinical research and health industry utilization, remains problematic. Legislation intended to improve access to personal data across national borders has proven to be a double-edged sword, where complexity and implications from misinterpretations have paradoxically resulted in data becoming more siloed. As a result, the potential for development of health specific AI and clinical decision support tools built on real-world data have yet to be fully realized. In this perspective, we propose federated networks as a solution to enable access to diverse data sets and tackle known and emerging health problems. The perspective draws on experience from the World Economic Forum Breaking Barriers to Health Data project, the Personal Health Train and Vantage6 infrastructures, and industry insights. We first define the concept of federated networks in a healthcare context, present the value they can bring to multiple stakeholders, and discuss their establishment, operation and implementation. Challenges of federated networks in healthcare are highlighted, as well as the resulting need for and value of an independent orchestrator for their safe, sustainable and scalable implementation.},

  abstract = {The goal of much observational research is to identify risk factors that have a causal effect on health and social outcomes. However, observational data are subject to biases from confounding, selection and measurement, which can result in an underestimate or overestimate of the effect of interest. Various advanced statistical approaches exist that offer certain advantages in terms of addressing these potential biases. However, although these statistical approaches have different underlying statistical assumptions, in practice they cannot always completely remove key sources of bias; therefore, using design-based approaches to improve causal inference is also important. Here it is the design of the study that addresses the problem of potential bias – either by ensuring it is not present (under certain assumptions) or by comparing results across methods with different sources and direction of potential bias. The distinction between statistical and design-based approaches is not an absolute one, but it provides a framework for triangulation – the thoughtful application of multiple approaches (e.g. statistical and design based), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and in particular sources and directions of bias. It is unlikely that any single method can provide a definite answer to a causal question, but the triangulation of evidence provided by different approaches can provide a stronger basis for causal inference. Triangulation can be considered part of wider efforts to improve the transparency and robustness of scientific research, and the wider scientific infrastructure and system of incentives.},

  abstract = {Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

Rapid advances in mobile technology offer the potential to mediate access to essential services. Through this research, the answers to the following question were explored: will mobile service platforms bridge the gap between service providers and people living at the base of the pyramid in developing countries? Anchored in interviews with 31 experts in the field of mobile and ICT, qualitative analysis starting from platform leadership to explain the role of mobile service platforms is presented: how operator, device and service provider centric platforms compete, collaborate and open up (or not) for delivering scalable services to the poor. Based on the analysis in this paper, it is portended that although operator centric platforms are in pole position, device centric platform providers, being astute innovators, are positioned to close the lead by presenting alternatives to bridge the gap in developing countries. This paper frames the current debate on M4D through the lens of platform theory, and aims to provide guidance to policy makers to improve access to services for the poor.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the development of technologies for causal inference with privacy preservation of distributed data has gained considerable attention. Many existing methods for distributed data focus on resolving the lack of subjects (samples) and can only reduce random errors in estimating treatment effects. In this study, we propose a data collaboration quasi-experiment (DC-QE) that resolves the lack of both subjects and covariates, reducing random errors and biases in the estimation. Our method involves constructing dimensionality-reduced intermediate representations from private data from local parties, sharing intermediate representations instead of private data for privacy preservation, estimating propensity scores from the shared intermediate representations, and finally, estimating the treatment effects from propensity scores. Through numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data, we confirm that our method leads to better estimation results than individual analyses. While dimensionality reduction loses some information in the private data and causes performance degradation, we observe that sharing intermediate representations with many parties to resolve the lack of subjects and covariates sufficiently improves performance to overcome the degradation caused by dimensionality reduction. Although external validity is not necessarily guaranteed, our results suggest that DC-QE is a promising method. With the widespread use of our method, intermediate representations can be published as open data to help researchers find causalities and accumulate a knowledge base.},

However, the current push towards widespread integration of artificial intelligence (AI) models, including in E2EE systems, raises some serious security concerns. This work performs a critical examination of the (in)compatibility of AI models and E2EE applications. We explore this on two fronts: (1) the integration of AI “assistants” within E2EE applications, and (2) the use of E2EE data for training AI models.  We analyze the potential security implications of each, and identify conflicts with the security guarantees of E2EE. Then, we analyze legal implications of integrating AI models in E2EE applications, given how AI integration can undermine the confidentiality that E2EE promises. Finally, we offer a list of detailed recommendations based on our technical and legal analyses, including: technical design choices that must be prioritized to uphold E2EE security; how service providers must accurately represent E2EE security; and best practices for the default behavior of AI features and for requesting user consent. We hope this paper catalyzes an informed conversation on the tensions that arise between the brisk deployment of AI and the security offered by E2EE, and guides the responsible development of new AI features.},

The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of \textbackslash federated optimization.},

Machine learning methods have been proved to be efficient in finding correlations in data, but unskilful to determine causation. This issue severely limits the applicability of machine learning methods to infer the causal relationships between the entities of a biological network, and more in general of any dynamical system, such as medical intervention strategies and clinical outcomes system, that is representable as a network. From the perspective of those who want to use the results of network inference not only to understand the mechanisms underlying the dynamics, but also to understand how the network reacts to external stimuli (e. g. environmental factors, therapeutic treatments), tools that can understand the causal relationships between data are highly demanded. Given the increasing popularity of machine learning techniques in computational biology and the recent literature proposing the use of machine learning techniques for the inference of biological networks, we would like to present the challenges that mathematics and computer science research faces in generalising machine learning to an approach capable of understanding causal relationships, and the prospects that achieving this will open up for the medical application domains of systems biology, the main paradigm of which is precisely network biology at any physical scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Moreover, human multi-omics data may be privacy-sensitive and can be misused to de-anonymize and (re-)identify individuals. Hence, most biomedical data is kept in secure and protected silos. Therefore, it remains a challenge to re-use these data without infringing the privacy of the individuals from which the data were derived. Federated analysis of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data is a privacypreserving solution to make optimal use of these multi-omics data and transform them into actionable knowledge. Results The Netherlands X-omics Initiative is a National Roadmap Large-Scale Research Infrastructure aiming for efficient integration of data generated within X-omics and external datasets. To facilitate this, we developed the FAIR Data Cube (FDCube), which adopts and applies the FAIR principles and helps researchers to create FAIR data and metadata, to facilitate re-use of their data, and to make their data analysis workflows transparent, and in the meantime ensure data security and privacy.},

  abstract = {This paper develops new insights into quantitative methods for the validation of computational model prediction. Four types of methods are investigated, namely classical and Bayesian hypothesis testing, a reliability-based method, and an area metric-based method. Traditional Bayesian hypothesis testing is extended based on interval hypotheses on distribution parameters and equality hypotheses on probability distributions, in order to validate models with deterministic/stochastic output for given inputs. Formulations and implementation details are outlined for both equality and interval hypotheses. Two types of validation experiments are considered—fully characterized (all the model/experimental inputs are measured and reported as point values) and partially characterized (some of the model/experimental inputs are not measured or are reported as intervals). Bayesian hypothesis testing can minimize the risk in model selection by properly choosing the model acceptance threshold, and its results can be used in model averaging to avoid Type I /II errors. It is shown that Bayesian interval hypothesis testing, the reliability-based method, and the area metric-based method can account for the existence of directional bias, where the mean predictions of a numerical model may be consistently below or above the corresponding experimental observations. It is also found that under some specific conditions, the Bayes factor metric in Bayesian equality hypothesis testing and the reliability-based metric can both be mathematically related to the p-value metric in classical hypothesis testing. Numerical studies are conducted to apply the above validation methods to gas damping prediction for radio frequency (RF) micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) switches. The model of interest is a general polynomial chaos (gPC) surrogate model constructed based on expensive runs of a physics-based simulation model, and validation data are collected from fully characterized experiments.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables a large number of devices to collaboratively learn a model without sharing their raw data. Despite its practical efficiency and effectiveness, the iterative on-device learning process incurs a considerable cost in terms of learning time and energy consumption, which depends crucially on the number of selected clients and the number of local iterations in each training round. In this paper, we analyze how to design adaptive FL that optimally chooses these essential control variables to minimize the total cost while ensuring convergence. Theoretically, we analytically establish the relationship between the total cost and the control variables with the convergence upper bound. To efficiently solve the cost minimization problem, we develop a low-cost sampling-based algorithm to learn the convergence related unknown parameters. We derive important solution properties that effectively identify the design principles for different metric preferences. Practically, we evaluate our theoretical results both in a simulated environment and on a hardware prototype. Experimental evidence verifies our derived properties and demonstrates that our proposed solution achieves near-optimal performance for various datasets, different machine learning models, and heterogeneous system settings.},

Exploiting a larger pool of labeled data available across multiple centers, such as in federated learning, has also seen limited success since current deep learning approaches do not generalize well to images acquired with scanners from different manufacturers. We aim to address these problems in a common, learning-based image simulation framework which we refer to as Federated Simulation. We introduce a physics-driven generative approach that consists of two learnable neural modules: 1) a module that synthesizes 3D cardiac shapes along with their materials, and 2) a CT simulator that renders these into realistic 3D CT Volumes, with annotations. Since the model of geometry and material is disentangled from the imaging sensor, it can effectively be trained across multiple medical centers. We show that our data synthesis framework improves the downstream segmentation performance on several datasets. Project Page: https://nv-tlabs.github.io/fed-sim/ .},

  abstract = {Healthcare organizations are interested in adopting collaborative systems to improve the quality of medical services. Recently, cloud computing has fueled the integration of modern information and communication technologies in the healthcare system. In fact, this new paradigm provides computational resources to the end users as services. Furthermore, it is used to share medical information across the healthcare ecosystem. But, protecting the patient's privacy in this environment is still a challenge that must be overcome. In fact, medical information is sensitive data that should be kept secret against unauthorized users. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach based on Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocols to ensure privacy-preserving in the collaborative systems. In this concept, different organizations collaborate to accomplish common goals without allowing any party to view and reveal another individual's private data. This paper aims at providing the fundamentals of the proposed protocols and their main applications in the healthcare system. In this context, we propose a framework based on SMC for privacy-preserving collaborative environment in the healthcare sector. The proposed solution is based on the Paillier scheme to ensure data security. This is achieved by exploiting the additive homomorphic property of this public key cryptosystem.},

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting.

  abstract = {When healthcare professionals have the choice between several drug treatments for their patients, they often experience considerable decision uncertainty because many decisions simply have no single “best” choice. The challenges are manifold and include that guideline recommendations focus on randomized controlled trials whose populations do not necessarily correspond to specific patients in everyday treatment. Further reasons may be insufficient evidence on outcomes, lack of direct comparison of distinct options, and the need to individually balance benefits and risks. All these situations will occur in routine care, its outcomes will be mirrored in routine data, and could thus be used to guide decisions. We propose a concept to facilitate decision-making by exploiting this wealth of information. Our working example for illustration assumes that the response to a particular (drug) treatment can substantially differ between individual patients depending on their characteristics (het­ erogeneous treatment effects, HTE), and that decisions will be more precise if they are based on real-world evidence of HTE considering this information. However, such methods must account for confounding by indication and effect measure modification, eg, by adequately using machine learning methods or parametric regressions to estimate individual responses to pharmacological treatments. The better a model assesses the underlying HTE, the more accurate are predicted probabilities of treatment response. After probabilities for treatmentrelated benefit and harm have been calculated, decision rules can be applied and patient preferences can be considered to provide individual recommendations. Emulated trials in observational data are a straightforward technique to predict the effects of such decision rules when applied in routine care. Prediction-based decision rules from routine data have the potential to efficiently supplement clinical guidelines and support healthcare professionals in creating personalized treatment plans using decision support tools.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models have had discernible achievements in a myriad of applications. However, most of these models are black-boxes, and it is obscure how the decisions are made by them. This makes the models unreliable and untrustworthy. To provide insights into the decision making processes of these models, a variety of traditional interpretable models have been proposed. Moreover, to generate more humanfriendly explanations, recent work on interpretability tries to answer questions related to causality such as "Why does this model makes such decisions?" or "Was it a specific feature that caused the decision made by the model?". In this work, models that aim to answer causal questions are referred to as causal interpretable models. The existing surveys have covered concepts and methodologies of traditional interpretability. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey on causal interpretable models from the aspects of the problems and methods. In addition, this survey provides in-depth insights into the existing evaluation metrics for measuring interpretability, which can help practitioners understand for what scenarios each evaluation metric is suitable.}

While the openness of digital platforms is an important theme in platform studies, the openness between platforms has hardly been studied. This paper explores factors that affect decisions by platform owners to open their platforms to other platforms. The focus is on Internet-of-Things platforms for automotive and healthcare applications. According to the findings, platform owners make trade-offs on whether to open up on a case-by-case basis. We identify a complex array of factors relating to direct benefits and costs (e.g., revenues from selling platform data), indirect benefits (e.g., attractiveness of the focal platform to users) as well as strategic consideration (e.g., improving bargaining power towards other actors). How businesses make trade-offs on these factors depends on market-level context (e.g., maturity of the market and standards) and organizational context (e.g., strategic focus and business objectives). Our findings provide a basis for future studies on the openness between platforms, which will become increasingly important as platforms proliferate in every layer of the digital industry.},

  abstract = {With the growth of data and intelligent technologies, the healthcare sector opened numerous technology that enabled services for patients, clinicians, and researchers. One major hurdle in achieving state-of-the-art results in health informatics is domain-specific terminologies and their semantic complexities. A knowledge graph crafted from medical concepts, events, and relationships acts as a medical semantic network to extract new links and hidden patterns from health data sources. Current medical knowledge graph construction studies are limited to generic techniques and opportunities and focus less on exploiting real-world data sources in knowledge graph construction. A knowledge graph constructed from Electronic Health Records (EHR) data obtains real-world data from healthcare records. It ensures better results in subsequent tasks like knowledge extraction and inference, knowledge graph completion, and medical knowledge graph applications such as diagnosis predictions, clinical recommendations, and clinical decision support. This review critically analyses existing works on medical knowledge graphs that used EHR data as the data source at (i) representation level, (ii) extraction level (iii) completion level. In this investigation, we found that EHR-based knowledge graph construction involves challenges such as high complexity and dimensionality of data, lack of knowledge fusion, and dynamic update of the knowledge graph. In addition, the study presents possible ways to tackle the challenges identified. Our findings conclude that future research should focus on knowledge graph integration and knowledge graph completion challenges.},

Method: A theoretical framework from literature on collective action theory, platform and business ecosystem concepts was developed to explain what factors influence interorganizational collective action for a common service platform. The framework was tested in a case study of collaborative platform project for independent living services in Finland. Semi-structured interviews with the project managers and the decision makers of involved organizations were the primary source of data collection. Result: Strikingly, interdependency among the organizations was not found to be important for collaboration in this case. Instead, we found that a central organization can play an important role in initiating, facilitating and encouraging collaboration among different parties. Moreover, we found more willingness for collaboration when the platform is aimed to be open to third-parties to complement the platform with additional services. Conclusions: Strategies of the platform leader and openness of the platform towards third parties are the most important drivers for collective action between organizations offering independent living services. Establishing common service platforms for independent living services requires explicit attention to these inter-organizational issues.},

Effective analysis of such repositories often necessitate a thorough understanding of dependencies in the data. For example, if the patient age is ignored, then one might wrongly conclude a causal relationship between cataract and hypertension. Such confounding variables are often identified by causal graphs, where variables are connected by causal relationships. Current approaches to automatically building such graphs are based on text analysis over medical literature; yet, the result is typically a large graph of low precision. There are statistical methods for constructing causal graphs from observational data, but they are less suitable for dealing with a large number of covariates, which is the case in EMR data. Consequently, confounding variables are often identified by medical domain experts via a manual, expensive, and time-consuming process.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is creating a paradigm shift in machine learning by directing the focus of model training to where the data actually exist. Instead of drawing all data into a central location, which raises concerns about privacy, costs, and delays, FL allows learning to take place directly on the device, keeping the data safe and minimizing the need for transfer. This approach is especially important in areas like healthcare, where protecting patient privacy is critical, and in industrial IoT settings, where moving large numbers of data is not practical. What makes FL even more compelling is its ability to reduce the bias that can occur when all data are centralized, leading to fairer and more inclusive machine learning outcomes. However, it is not without its challenges—particularly with regard to keeping the models secure from attacks. Nonetheless, the potential benefits are clear: FL can lower the costs associated with data storage and processing, while also helping organizations to meet strict privacy regulations like GDPR. As edge computing continues to grow, FL’s decentralized approach could play a key role in shaping how we handle data in the future, moving toward a more privacy-conscious world. This study identifies ongoing challenges in ensuring model security against adversarial attacks, pointing to the need for further research in this area.},

However, the acquisition and management of a large amount of data in some domains, as for example healthcare, can be problematic on account of the adoption of centralized architectures which entail certain security and privacy risks. Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a technological solution to address such questions, even though communication efficiency may be a significant issue. Methods: This paper presents a novel learning strategy aimed at reducing the total number of parameters shared during the FL process and therefore, at evaluating a trade-off between the requirement to bring down communication costs and the need to guarantee the highest classification performance. Results: The results demonstrate the goodness of the solution in comparison with the traditional FedAvg algorithm since the accuracy of the proposed approach shows values ranging from 89.25\% to 96.6\% and, and in addition, the reduction of the communication overheads shows improvements ranging from 95.64\% to 6\%. Conclusion: The analysis of the proposed approach shows promising results in terms of performance and communication costs, especially in relation to the total amount of moved data since the challenge addressed by the paper concerns communication efficiency during the training process.},

  abstract = {The fundamental challenge of drawing causal inference is that counterfactual outcomes are not fully observed for any unit. Furthermore, in observational studies, treatment assignment is likely to be confounded. Many statistical methods have emerged for causal inference under unconfoundedness conditions given pre-treatment covariates, including propensity score-based methods, prognostic score-based methods, and doubly robust methods. Unfortunately for applied researchers, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ causal method that can perform optimally universally. In practice, causal methods are primarily evaluated quantitatively on handcrafted simulated data. Such data-generative procedures can be of limited value because they are typically stylized models of reality. They are simplified for tractability and lack the complexities of real-world data. For applied researchers, it is critical to understand how well a method performs for the data at hand. Our work introduces a deep generative model-based framework, Credence, to validate causal inference methods. The framework’s novelty stems from its ability to generate synthetic data anchored at the empirical distribution for the observed sample, and therefore virtually indistinguishable from the latter. The approach allows the user to specify ground truth for the form and magnitude of causal effects and confounding bias as functions of covariates. Thus simulated data sets are used to evaluate the potential performance of various causal estimation methods when applied to data similar to the observed sample. We demonstrate Credence’s ability to accurately assess the relative performance of causal estimation techniques in an extensive simulation study and two real-world data applications from Lalonde and Project STAR studies.},

We present a robust aggregation approach to make federated learning robust to settings when a fraction of the devices may be sending corrupted updates to the server. The approach relies on a robust aggregation oracle based on the geometric median, which returns a robust aggregate using a constant number of iterations of a regular non-robust averaging oracle. The robust aggregation oracle is privacy-preserving, similar to the non-robust secure average oracle it builds upon. We establish its convergence for least squares estimation of additive models. We provide experimental results with linear models and deep networks for three tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. The robust aggregation approach is agnostic to the level of corruption; it outperforms the classical aggregation approach in terms of robustness when the level of corruption is high, while being competitive in the regime of low corruption. Two variants, a faster one with one-step robust aggregation and another one with on-device personalization, round off the paper.},

However, traditional approaches do not always deliver unconfounded causal conclusions in practice. The rise of “doubly robust” nonparametric tools coupled with the growth of deep learning for capturing rich representations of multimodal data offers a unique opportunity to develop and test such models for causal inference on comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs). In this article, we investigate causal modeling of an RCT-established causal association: the effect of classes of antihypertensive on incident cancer risk. We develop a transformer-based model, targeted bidirectional EHR transformer (T-BEHRT) coupled with doubly robust estimation to estimate average risk ratio (RR). We compare our model to benchmark statistical and deep learning models for causal inference in multiple experiments on semi-synthetic derivations of our dataset with various types and intensities of confounding. In order to further test the reliability of our approach, we test our model on situations of limited data. We find that our model provides more accurate estimates of relative risk [least sum absolute error (SAE) from ground truth] compared with benchmark estimations. Finally, our model provides an estimate of class-wise antihypertensive effect on cancer risk that is consistent with results derived from RCTs.},

Federated learning is a state-of-the-art distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients are allowed to collaboratively train a model while keeping their private training data locally. Although federated learning seems to be a viable solution for jointly training a machine learning model without compromising privacy, sensitive privacy information may still be leaked through shared model parameters and query results. Over the past six years, the researchers have extensively studied privacy protection enhancements of federated learning, and they have revealed that general privacy protection mechanisms can be adopted to mitigate privacy issues of federated learning. However, protecting privacy through federated learning while maintaining data utility is still an open issue.

  abstract = {Discovering causal effects is at the core of scientific investigation but remains challenging when only observational data are available. In practice, causal networks are difficult to learn and interpret, and limited to relatively small datasets. We report a more reliable and scalable causal discovery method (iMIIC), based on a general mutual information supremum principle, which greatly improves the precision of inferred causal relations while distinguishing genuine causes from putative and latent causal effects. We showcase iMIIC on synthetic and real-world healthcare data from 396,179 breast cancer patients from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. More than 90\% of predicted causal effects appear correct, while the remaining unexpected direct and indirect causal effects can be interpreted in terms of diagnostic procedures, therapeutic timing, patient preference or socio-economic disparity. iMIIC’s unique capabilities open up new avenues to discover reliable and interpretable causal networks across a range of research fields.},

Existing medical data is not fully exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making the transition from research to clinical practice.

  abstract = {We describe an approach and our experiences in applying federated simulation techniques to create large-scale parallel simulations of computer networks. Using the federated approach, the topology and the protocol stack of the simulated network is partitioned into a number of submodels, and a simulation process is instantiated for each one. Runtime infrastructure software provides services for interprocess communication and synchronization (time management). We first describe issues that arise in homogeneous federations where a sequential simulator is federated with itself to realize a parallel implementation. We then describe additional issues that must be addressed in heterogeneous federations composed of different network simulation packages, and describe a dynamic simulation backplane mechanism that facilitates interoperability among different network simulators. Specifically, the dynamic simulation backplane provides a means of addressing key issues that arise in federating different network simulators: differing packet representations, incomplete implementations of network protocol models, and differing levels of detail among the simulation processes. We discuss two different methods for using the backplane for interactions between heterogeneous simulators: the cross-protocol stack method and the split-protocol stack method. Finally, results from an experimental study are presented for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases that provide evidence of the scalability of our federated approach on two moderately sized computing clusters. Two different homogeneous implementations are described: Parallel/Distributed ns ( pdns ) and the Georgia Tech Network Simulator ( GTNetS ). Results of a heterogeneous implementation federating ns with GloMoSim are described. This research demonstrates that federated simulations are a viable approach to realizing efficient parallel network simulation tools.},

Beyond the inherent capabilities of adding domain knowledge into learning systems, CML provides a complete toolset for investigating how a system would react to an intervention (e.g. outcome given a treatment). Quantifying effects of interventions allows actionable decisions to be made while maintaining robustness in the presence of confounders. Here, we explore how causal inference can be incorporated into different aspects of clinical decision support systems by using recent advances in machine learning. Throughout this paper, we use Alzheimer’s disease to create examples for illustrating how CML can be advantageous in clinical scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges present in healthcare applications such as processing high-dimensional and unstructured data, generalization to out-of-distribution samples and temporal relationships, that despite the great effort from the research community remain to be solved. Finally, we review lines of research within causal representation learning, causal discovery and causal reasoning which offer the potential towards addressing the aforementioned challenges.},

  abstract = {Multisite medical data sharing is critical in modern clinical practice and medical research. The challenge is to conduct data sharing that preserves individual privacy and data utility. The shortcomings of traditional privacy-enhancing technologies mean that institutions rely upon bespoke data sharing contracts. The lengthy process and administration induced by these contracts increases the inefficiency of data sharing and may disincentivize important clinical treatment and medical research.  This paper provides a synthesis between 2 novel advanced privacy-enhancing technologies—homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation (defined together as multiparty homomorphic encryption). These privacy-enhancing technologies provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with multiparty homomorphic encryption providing a performance advantage over separately using homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation. We argue multiparty homomorphic encryption fulfills legal requirements for medical data sharing under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation which has set a global benchmark for data protection. Specifically, the data processed and shared using multiparty homomorphic encryption can be considered anonymized data. We explain how multiparty homomorphic encryption can reduce the reliance upon customized contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate the pace of medical research while offering additional incentives for health care and research institutes to employ common data interoperability standards.},

  abstract = {Causal inference is a broad field that seeks to build and apply models that learn the effect of interventions on outcomes using many data types. While the field has existed for decades, its potential to impact healthcare outcomes has increased dramatically recently due to both advancements in machine learning and the unprecedented amounts of observational data resulting from electronic capture of patient claims data by medical insurance companies and widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) worldwide. However, there are many different schools of learning causality coming from different fields of statistics, some of them strongly conflicting. While the recent advances in machine learning greatly enhanced causal inference from a modeling perspective, it further exacerbated the fractured state in this field. This fractured state has limited research at the intersection of causal inference, modern machine learning, and EHRs that could potentially transform healthcare. In this paper we unify the classical causal inference approaches with new machine learning developments into a straightforward framework based on whether the researcher is most interested in finding the best intervention for an individual, a group of similar people, or an entire population. Through this lens, we then provide a timely review of the applications of causal inference in healthcare from the literature. As expected, we found that applications of causal inference in medicine were mostly limited to just a few technique types and lag behind other domains. In light of this gap, we offer a helpful schematic to guide data scientists and healthcare stakeholders in selecting appropriate causal methods and reviewing the findings generated by them.},

  abstract = {Polymorphic encryption and Pseudonymisation, abbreviated as PEP, form a novel approach for the management of sensitive personal data, especially in health care. Traditional encryption is rather rigid: once encrypted, only one key can be used to decrypt the data. This rigidity is becoming an every greater problem in the context of big data analytics, where different parties who wish to investigate part of an encrypted data set all need the one key for decryption. Polymorphic encryption is a new cryptographic technique that solves these problems. Together with the associated technique of polymorphic pseudonymisation new security and privacy guarantees can be given which are essential in areas such as (personalised) healthcare, medical data collection via self-measurement apps, and more generally in privacy-friendly identity management and data analytics. The key ideas of polymorphic encryption are: 1. Directly after generation, data can be encrypted in a `polymorphic' manner and stored at a (cloud) storage facility in such a way that the storage provider cannot get access. Crucially, there is no need to a priori fix who gets to see the data, so that the data can immediately be protected. For instance a PEP-enabled self-measurement device will store all its measurement data in polymorphically encrypted form in a back-end data base. 2. Later on it can be decided who can decrypt the data. This decision will be made on the basis of a policy, in which the data subject should play a key role. The user of the PEP-enabled device can, for instance, decide that doctors \$X,Y,Z\$ may at some stage decrypt to use the data in their diagnosis, or medical researcher groups \$A, B, C\$ may use it for their investigations, or third parties \$U,V,W\$ may use it for additional services, etc. 3. This `tweaking' of the encrypted data to make it decryptable by a specific party can be done in a blind manner. It will have to be done by a trusted party who knows how to tweak the ciphertext for whom. This PEP technology can provide the necessary security and privacy infrastructure for big data analytics. People can entrust their data in polymorphically encrypted form, and each time decide later to make (parts of) it available (decryptable) for specific parties, for specific analysis purposes. In this way users remain in control, and can monitor which of their data is used where by whom for which purposes. The polymorphic encryption infrastructure can be supplemented with a pseudonymisation infrastructure which is also polymorphic, and guarantees that each individual will automatically have different pseudonyms at different parties and can only be de-pseudonymised by participants (like medical doctors) who know the original identity. This white paper provides an introduction to Polymorphic Encryption and Pseudonymisation (PEP), at different levels of abstraction, focusing on health care as application area. It contains a general description of PEP, explaining the basic functionality for laymen, supplemented by a clarification of the legal framework provided by the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. The paper also contains a more advanced, mathematically oriented description of PEP, including the underlying cryptographic primitives, key and pseudonym managment, interaction protocols, etc. This second part is aimed at readers with a background in computer security and cryptography. The cryptographic basis for PEP is ElGamal public key encryption, which is well-known since the mid 1980s. It is the way in which this encryption is used --- with re-randomisation, re-keying and re-shuffling --- that is new. The PEP framework is currently elaborated into an open design and open source (prototype) implementation at Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The technology will be used and tested in a real-life medical research project at the Radboud University Medical Center.},

The data sources may have different distributions; the causal effects are independently and systematically incorporated. The proposed method estimates the similarities among the sources through transfer coefficients, and hence requiring no prior information about the similarity measures. The heterogeneous causal effects can be estimated with no sharing of the raw training data among the sources, thus minimizing the risk of privacy leak.

  abstract = {This introductory article sets out the twin goals of this special issue: “Advancing the Commonsverse: The Political Economy of the Commons”. The first is to introduce the innovative work of David Bollier and Silke Helfrich in theorizing and researching the commons. The second is to explore the possibilities and constraints of the commons and the process of commoning as they unfold in real-world political-economic settings. Bollier and Helfrich have formulated a remarkable, ‘in-the-round’, moral-empirical theory of the commons. In their social ontology, peer governance and moral economy commons form a subversive alternative to the capitalist order. Bollier and Helfrich’s theory restores an older tradition of a moral critique of capitalism in the tradition of “moral economists” such as Karl Polanyi and H.P. Tawney. It raises important questions about the socio-ethical foundations of our society and economy, the relationship between civil associations and the state, and the nature of the state. In the final part of this introduction, we discuss the complex relationship between the commons and the state. We frame this relationship as one of mutual dependency and argue for the careful redesign of our institutions of public administration and democratic governance to make them more receptive and accessible to the creative powers of the commons. Finally, we introduce the contributions to this special issue, including a reflective concluding essay by David Bolllier.},

  abstract = {Federated learning and analytics are a distributed approach for collaboratively learning models (or statistics) from decentralized data, motivated by and designed for privacy protection. The distributed learning process can be formulated as solving federated optimization problems, which emphasize communication efficiency, data heterogeneity, compatibility with privacy and system requirements, and other constraints that are not primary considerations in other problem settings. This paper provides recommendations and guidelines on formulating, designing, evaluating and analyzing federated optimization algorithms through concrete examples and practical implementation, with a focus on conducting effective simulations to infer real-world performance. The goal of this work is not to survey the current literature, but to inspire researchers and practitioners to design federated learning algorithms that can be used in various practical applications.},

  abstract = {The escalating influx of data generated by networked edge devices, coupled with the growing awareness of data privacy, has restricted the traditional data analytics workflow, where the edge data are gathered by a centralized server to be further utilized by data analysts. To continue leveraging vast edge data to support various data-incentive applications, computing paradigms have promoted a transformative shift from centralized data processing to privacy-preserved distributed data processing. The need to perform data analytics on private edge data motivates federated analytics (FA), an emerging technique to support collaborative data analytics among diverse data owners without centralizing the raw data. Despite the wide applications of FA in industry and academia, a comprehensive examination of existing research efforts in FA has been notably absent. This survey aims to bridge this gap by first providing an overview of FA, elucidating key concepts, and discussing its relationship with similar concepts. We then thoroughly examine FA, including its key challenges, taxonomy, and enabling techniques. Diverse FA applications, including statistical metrics, frequency-related applications, database query operations, FL-assisting FA tasks, and other wireless network applications are then carefully reviewed. We complete the survey with several open research issues, future directions, and a comprehensive lessons learned part. This survey intends to provide a holistic understanding of the emerging FA techniques and foster the continued evolution of privacy-preserving distributed data processing in the emerging networked society.},

  abstract = {Analyzing observational data from multiple sources can be useful for increasing statistical power to detect a treatment effect; however, practical constraints such as privacy considerations may restrict individual-level information sharing across data sets. This paper develops federated methods that only utilize summary-level information from heterogeneous data sets. Our federated methods provide doubly-robust point estimates of treatment effects as well as variance estimates. We derive the asymptotic distributions of our federated estimators, which are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the corresponding estimators from the combined, individual-level data. We show that to achieve these properties, federated methods should be adjusted based on conditions such as whether models are correctly specified and stable across heterogeneous data sets.},

Beyond the federated learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures and applications for the federated learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allow knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.},

  abstract = {Causal discovery, the inference of causal relations among variables from data, is a fundamental problem of science. Nowadays, due to an increased awareness of data privacy concerns, there has been a shift towards distributed data collection, processing and storage. To meet the pressing need for distributed causal discovery, we propose a novel federated DAG learning method called distributed annealing on regularized likelihood score (DARLS) to learn a causal graph from data stored on multiple clients. DARLS simulates an annealing process to search over the space of topological sorts, where the optimal graphical structure compatible with a sort is found by distributed optimization. This distributed optimization relies on multiple rounds of communication between local clients and a central server to estimate the graphical structure. We establish its convergence to the solution obtained by an oracle with access to all the data. To the best of our knowledge, DARLS is the first distributed method for learning causal graphs with such finite-sample oracle guarantees. To establish the consistency of DARLS, we also derive new identifiability results for causal graphs parameterized by generalized linear models, which could be of independent interest. Through extensive simulation studies and a real-world application, we show that DARLS outperforms existing federated learning methods and is comparable to oracle methods on pooled data, demonstrating its great advantages in estimating causal networks from distributed data.},

  abstract = {Shielding neural networks (NNs) from untrusted hosts with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) has been increasingly adopted. Nevertheless, this paper shows that the confidentiality of NNs and user data is compromised by the recently disclosed ciphertext side channels in TEEs, which leak memory write patterns of TEE-shielded NNs to malicious hosts. While recent works have used ciphertext side channels to recover cryptographic key bits, the technique does not apply to NN inputs which are more complex and only have partial information leaked. We propose an automated input recovery framework, CipherSteal, and for the first time demonstrate the severe threat of ciphertext side channels to NN inputs. CipherSteal novelly recasts the input recovery as a two-step approach — information transformation and reconstruction — and proposes optimizations to fully utilize partial input information leaked in ciphertext side channels. We evaluate CipherSteal on diverse NNs (e.g., Transformer) and image/video inputs, and successfully recover visually identical inputs under different levels of attacker’s pre-knowledge towards the target NNs and their inputs. We comprehensively evaluate two popular NN frameworks, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and NN executables generated by two recent NN compilers, TVM and Glow, and study their different attack surfaces. Moreover, we further steal the target NN’s functionality by training a surrogate NN with our recovered inputs, and also leverage the surrogate NN to generate "white-box" adversarial examples, effectively manipulating the target NN’s predictions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a synchronization problem is investigated for an array of coupled complex discrete-time networks with the simultaneous presence of both the discrete and distributed time delays. The complex networks addressed which include neural and social networks as special cases are quite general. Rather than the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sectorlike nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The distributed infinite time delays in the discrete-time domain are first defined. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed discrete-time complex network with distributed delays is synchronized if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible discrete and distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, an LMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two simulation examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization and state estimation conditions. It is worth pointing out that our main results are valid even if the nominal subsystems within the network are unstable.},

  abstract = {Federated heavy hitter analytics enables service providers to better understand the preferences of cross-party users by analyzing the most frequent items. As with federated learning, it faces challenges of privacy concerns, statistical heterogeneity, and expensive communication. Local differential privacy (LDP), as the de facto standard for privacy-preserving data collection, solves the privacy challenge by letting each user perturb her data locally and report the sanitized version. However, in federated settings, applying LDP complicates the other two challenges, due to the deteriorated utility by the injected LDP noise or increasing communication/computation costs by perturbation mechanism. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel target-aligning prefix tree mechanism satisfying ε-LDP, for federated heavy hitter analytics. In particular, we propose an adaptive extension strategy to address the inconsistencies between covering necessary prefixes and estimating heavy hitters within a party to enhance the utility. We also present a consensus-based pruning strategy that utilizes noisy prior knowledge from other parties to further align the inconsistency between finding heavy hitters in each party and providing reasonable frequency information to identify the global ones. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first solution to the federated heavy hitter analytics in a cross-party setting while satisfying the stringent ε-LDP. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.},

We start with the curious observation that Friedman’s partial dependence plot has exactly the same formula as Pearl’s back-door adjustment and discuss three requirements to make causal interpretations: a model with good predictive performance, some domain knowledge in the form of a causal diagram and suitable visualization tools. We provide several illustrative examples and find some interesting and potentially causal relations using visualization tools for black-box models.},

To support unsupervised applications, we introduce FedWeight ETM, a federated embedded topic model. We evaluated FedWeight in cross-site FL on the eICU dataset and cross-dataset FL between eICU and MIMIC III. FedWeight consistently outperforms standard FL baselines in predicting ICU mortality, ventilator use, sepsis diagnosis, and length of stay. SHAP-based interpretation and ETM-based topic modeling reveal improved identification of clinically relevant characteristics and disease topics associated with ICU readmission.},
